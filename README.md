# Guided-Inquiry-11----Node-Intro

## This repository contains 3 folders named EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD.

The Easy folder has all the learnyounode exercises (1-5)

The Medium folder has the exercise where a text file full of solar systems are read and printed onto the console.

The Hard folder contains a JSON file where 10 employee names are read with an API.

I had trouble doing this guided inquiry since it was given to us in the middle of mid-evals. And trying to proritize learning a new concept while reviewing/cramming old ones proved to be a challenge.
