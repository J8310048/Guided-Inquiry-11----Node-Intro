# Guided-Inquiry-11----Node-Intro

## This repository contains 3 folders named EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD.

The Easy folder has all the learnyounode exercises (1-5). I learned the importance in keeping track of the changes your index will go through when put through 2 for loops.

The Medium folder has the exercise where a text file full of solar systems are read and printed onto a console. Just type node (filename) and it will display all the names.

The Hard folder contains a JSON file where 10 employee names are read with an API. How it works is you type localhost:3000/employees in the toolbar to access the data, and to find a specific employee, their IDs are from 001 to 010 (in case you're wondering, yes I took inspiration from James Bond!).

Example: localhost:3000/employees/007

I had trouble doing this guided inquiry since it was given to us in the middle of mid-evals. And trying to proritize learning a new concept while reviewing/cramming old ones proved to be a challenge. But what I learned is everything can be solved with a simple google search.
